Zombie Apocalypse Simulation

By Jared Scratch (GitHub: chonbidesu)

Overview

Zombie Apocalypse is a single-player, offline game inspired by Urban Dead, a free-to-play, text-based MMORPG created by British developer Kevan Davis. The game is set in a quarantined region of the fictional city of Malton, following the aftermath of a zombie outbreak.

Players take on the role of either a survivor or a zombie, each with unique abilities and limitations. Survivors who are killed will return as zombies, while zombies can be revived with the right technology to become human again. Unlike Urban Dead, where other characters are controlled by human players, Zombie Apocalypse uses AI to simulate NPCs, allowing fans of the original game to enjoy a similar experience offline.

This project is a tribute to Urban Dead and its community, developed in response to the dwindling player base and the possibility of the official game servers shutting down.

Installation

No installation required! Simply run the latest distributable version for your OS.
Executable files can be found in the dist folder.
Important: Since I am not a known publisher, Windows may flag the file as dangerous, and some antivirus software may show false positives.
Alternatively, you can run the source code by executing main.py (requires Python and Pygame installed).
