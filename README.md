Zombie Apocalypse Simulation
by Jared Scratch (GitHub: chonbidesu)

Overview

Zombie Apocalypse is a single-player, offline game modeled after Urban Dead, a free-to-play HTML/text-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game created by British developer Kevan Davis. Set in a quarantined region of the fictional city of Malton, it deals with the aftermath of a zombie outbreak. Players enter the game either as a survivor or a zombie, each with different abilities and limitations. Survivors become zombies when they are killed, while zombies can be "revivified" with appropriate technology, returning to life as a survivor â€“ any character played for long will thus spend some time alive and some as a zombie.
Zombie Apocalypse differs from Urban Dead in that, as an offline game, other characters are controlled by AI rather than other human users. All credit for the base game mechanics and concepts goes to Kevan Davis. My contribution is to create an offline version for fans of the game to enjoy the nostalgia, as the player-base dwindles and the future possibility of the game servers going offline looms.
