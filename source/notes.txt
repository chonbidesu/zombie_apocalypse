zombie state needs a weapon class

This needs a home:
        self.game.ticker += 1

        # Check buildings for fuel expiry
        for row in self.game.city.grid:
            for block in row:
                if hasattr(block, 'fuel_expiration') and block.fuel_expiration < self.game.ticker:
                    if block.lights_on:
                        block.lights_on = False

        # Each character gains an action point
        for character in self.game.characters.list:              
            character.action_points += 1
            character.state.act()
